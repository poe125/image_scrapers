This is the code for scraping images from a website.
It scrapes the images, put it in the images folder, then compile them into a pdf.

Modifications needed by the user:
Modify one line where it says ############## DEFINITE PATH TO YOUR OUTPUT ##############
Example:
outfile = "C://YOUR//DEFINITE//PATH"
Also create a file named "images" in the same file as the main code.
This will be where the images are stored temporarily.

How to use the API:
1. Run the code
2. Enter the URL of the website
